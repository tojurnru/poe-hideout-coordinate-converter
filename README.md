## Config.json Settings
- `HIDEOUT_FILE`: the original file you'd like to copy
- `NEW_HIDEOUT_NAME`: new hideout you'd like to copy to (e.g.: Celestial Nebula Hideout)
- `NEW_HIDEOUT_HASH`: hash of the new hideout (refer `*.hideout` file for the hash value)
- `DIFF_X`: difference of x coordinate
- `DIFF_Y`: difference of y coordinate
